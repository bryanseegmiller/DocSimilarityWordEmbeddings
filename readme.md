Scripts:
	-ONETOccupationSimilarities.py--Python script that cleans and prepares tasks statements, 
	 creates numerical representations of documents, and creates occupation-by-occupation
	 task similarities. Outputs them to Stata datasets. 

	-SimilarityOccupationFlows.do--Reads in output from ONETOccupationSimilarities.py and
	 uses it to predict worker occupation-to-occupation flows. Prints tables 3 and 4 of paper 
		Requires a few additional Stata packages. See comment at top of script if not already installed

Notes: 
	-ONETOccupationSimilarities.py was created using Python 3.9.12, but should work with Python >= 3.6.0
         Gensim version 4.1.2 was used (see requirements.txt), but script should work with Gensim >= 4.0.0
